# Hazus Flood Assessment Structure Tool

The Hazus Flood Assessment Structure Tool (FAST) calculates building-level flood impacts with user-provided building and flood depth data. FAST uses the Hazus Flood model methodology to assign depth damage functions to buildings according to their occupancy type, first floor elevation, foundation type, and number of stories. Flood depth is then extracted at every building and used as a depth damage function parameter to calculate flood losses in dollars. Flood-generated debris is estimated using building area in square feet. For more information about how FAST cacluates flood impacts, please refer to the Hazus Flood Technical Manual: https://www.fema.gov/media-library-data/20130726-1820-25045-8292/hzmh2_1_fl_tm.pdf

Building data must be formatted as a .csv file according to the specifications outlined here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTBuildingData.pdf Flood depth data must be formatted as a .tiff raster. Sample building data for Honolulu, HI are included in the "UDF" folder.

FAST is developed using the Hazus Python Package. This tool automatically checks for updates each time its opened. The Hazus Team would like to thank the Oregon Department of Geology and Mineral Industries for developing an early version of this tool: https://www.oregongeology.org/pubs/ofr/O-18-04/O-18-04_user_guide.pdf

## Requirements

The Flood Assessment Structure Tool requires conda be installed on your computer. If you haven't already, follow this [README](https://github.com/nhrap-dev/Environment-Setup/tree/update-README) to setup your machine with miniforge and conda before trying to run FAST
 
## Documentation

Please see the Help folder for building data guidance, FAST case study information (coming soon), and a brief video demonstration of FAST: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/tree/master/Help

**2. Place your formatted building data in the "UDF" subfolder. Place your flood depth data in the "Rasters" subfolder.
Guidance for formatting building data can be found here: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTBuildingData.pdf***

**3. Double-click "FAST.py" If you don't have the Hazus Python Library installed, follow the prompt to install, then double-click "FAST.py" again.**

To customize the damage functions used by FAST to calculate losses, review these guidelines: https://github.com/nhrap-hazus/FAST/blob/master/Help/FASTDamageFunctions.pdf

Install and Uninstall directions can be found [here](https://github.com/nhrap-dev/Environment-Setup/tree/update-README).

**For FAST versions 0.0.7 and below**
These versions use Anaconda for the Python environment. It is recommended to update to the latest tool version by uninstalling Anaconda and installing Miniforge and Conda and then downloading the latest version of the tool. Refer to the instructions [here](https://github.com/nhrap-dev/Environment-Setup/tree/update-README) to perform the uninstall.
